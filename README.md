Prattle is a simple chat program written in C++, using SFML.

Currently, console chat is possible and a secure user database exists. A GUI, file transfer facility, multiple friendlist and online statuses with a range of other stuff will be added soon.

**P.S. Active development is being done in the [test][4] branch**
