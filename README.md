Prattle is a simple chat program written in C++, using SFML's networking module and TGUI for the GUI.

Currently, the features supported are:

* Registration (Username and password)
* Login
* Chatting in pairs (with multiple persons)
* Adding Friends
* Simple Notifications (for unread messages)
* Online Statuses
* Autologin (aka Remember Me facility)

For the details about the communication protocols we use, take a look at the [network documentation][1].


NOTE
=====

We have not yet started with the security layer, so it's not recommened at this stage that Prattle be used for IM communication!
