NOTE : The current code though complete is ridden with many spooky and tiny bugs right now.

Prattle is a simple chat program written in C++, using SFML's networking module and TGUI for the GUI.

Currently, the features supported are:

* Basic registration
* Login
* Chatting in pairs

You can view our [to-do list][1] and Prattle's status on Trello.
